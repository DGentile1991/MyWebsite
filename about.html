        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
         <p>
             TOWN combines a variety of chinese cuisine to excite and delight our customers. Our vision for the future is to create experiential dining that is more than just a night out. We aim to bring quality and luxury across all aspects of our brand. The approach of TOWN is to develop our brand with the understanding of both our culture and consumer insights. Within our vision always lives the promise of inspiring creativity, conversation and quality. Our audience is a high-end clientele who values a dining experience. The age range of our customers are from early 30s-60s. We would like them to come back for both personal dining and events. 
         </p>
         
         <h1>Our History</h1>
             <p>
                 My parents started this restaurant when I was only seven years old. They had me in here washing dishes and sweeping the floors. As I got older they let me start learning how to cook the dishes, run the cash register and learn other responsibilities. Thirty years later and I have now been able to take over the family business. I strive to make this a special environment for not only our guests, but my employees as well. I intend to build this into the "go-to" place for high-end chinese cuisine, but more importantly, the high-end experience.
